Blue Spree
=========

Blue Spree is a skin for the Jplayer Playlist javasctipt library. The name comes from the Spree brand candy, because the play button looks kind of like a blue piece of candy. 

The project started with a desire to build an audio jukebox. Playing guitar is one of my interests, and I wanted to share my songs on the web. But providing a link to an MP3 file is not ideal. To listen you have to download the file and then open it in iTunes or whatever and then play it. I wanted to offer my website visitors an opportunity to hear the music immediately. So I looked at using Javascript to build an audio player. Luckily there are good libraries like Jplayer available. But I wanted to go a step further, and customize the player's look and feel to match my website. So I created this skin Blue Spree to provide a jukebox like listening experience on my website. 

Supports Jplayer Playlist, but I hope to add support and design elements for the other modes of audio playback, including the single song mode. Assets include a layered PSD file, HTML, JS, CSS and graphic sprites.

A demo will be posted to the web at
