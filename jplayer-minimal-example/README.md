Minimal jPlayer Example
=========
This is [jPlayer](http://jplayer.org/) sample code, but stripped down to the bare minimum. I made this because [existing](http://jplayer.org/latest/quick-start-guide/) [sample code](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/skin-orman-clarks-video-interface-using-jplayer-and-css--webdesign-6166) for jPlayer includes too many unnecessary extras, e.g. player controls and a nice stylesheet.

This is really a stripped down version of [Luke Spoor's jPlayer skinning tutorial](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/skin-orman-clarks-video-interface-using-jplayer-and-css--webdesign-6166).
