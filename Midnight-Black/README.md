Midnight Black
=========
Quite a while ago, I found this great jPlayer skin on GitHub. It was nice, simple, and great looking! But what I soon found out was that it was only for jPlayer 2.0.0. That got me thinking, "Hey! Why don't I update it?!". And I did just that!

It actually ended up looking pretty good :D

Announcments
=========
The latest version of Midnight Black (v2.6.1) has been submitted with an entirely redone CSS file. Now it's much easier to maintain the entire project than it was before. Also, in the future, I plan on adding HD support but that won't come around until version 3.0 or whenever the next version of jPlayer comes out.

Compatibility
=========
Midnight Black will support any jPlayer version from 2.1.0 all the way to the current developmental build. I recommend you keep up to date on your jPlayer installation. Midnight Black also uses some CSS3 features such as *border-radius*, *text-shadow*, and *box-shadow* (specifically *box-shdaow: inset*) so it won't show up in IE8 or lower. If you want, you can use [CSS3PIE](http://css3pie.com/) to enable *border-radius* in IE8 and lower but *text-shadow* and *box-shadow: inset* are still a WIP. I'll add support for CSS3PIE as soon as they add more functionality to it.
