nedna - node.js streaming mp3 server

Written by Emil Loer <http://koffietijd.net>

A project inspired by Edna, the python based mp3 server. Edna was rather
buggy, slow and lacked a lot of functionality. Therefore a rewrite was in 
order.

Installation:
 - git clone git@github.com:thedjinn/nedna.git
 - git submodule init
 - git submodule update
 - npm install inotify@0.1.3 (or 0.1.4 if you can get it to install correctly)

Running:
 - edit the file nedna.js and change the music directory paths
 - node nedna.js
 - go to http://localhost:8192/ and enjoy
